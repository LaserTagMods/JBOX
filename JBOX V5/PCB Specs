This is the JBOX V5

updated pcb is 3" by 6.6" - will have lots of optional components for JBOX V5 that will work with the modes/settings. Code is near complete for testing and I'm building a protoype now. Components include:

-RGB 5mm CC LED for communicating Status and mode
-RGB LED Strip for communicating status and mode
-PIM MINI Motion Sensor - Proximity Sensor for detecting players nearby
-RYAX RYL896 for Base toBase communication - long range for multibase domination and base capture game play
-ESP32 Full size dev board
-IR Sensor TSOP
-IR LED Circuit +/- with adjustable voltage regulator and port for a 470-1000 capacitor voltage range up to 25V max for IR circuit and a npn2222A transistor for up to 1AMP current, recommend pushing to 1.2A
-Battery supply input for up to 40V max battery input
-Voltage regulator for esp32 and low powered components
-Resistor pin holes with recommended resistor sizes on board
-OLED 4 pin port for display of mode, game status, etc.
-Power output for Siren/Alarm - recommended 15watt max siren, but can handle up to 3amps, regulator support up to 30V but recommend 12v at 1.2 amps, Mosfet pin holes and resistor pin holes with recommended components
